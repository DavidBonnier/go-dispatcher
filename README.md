A worker-pool job dispatcher inspired by the [Post: Handling 1 Million Requests per Minute with Go](http://marcio.io/2015/07/handling-1-million-requests-per-minute-with-golang/).

* Easily run batches of jobs in sequence, for algorithms that involve running a set of independent tasks concurrently for a while, then all wait on a barrier, and repeat again.
* Limit total number of goroutines to prevent it from draining out resources.

## How it works

                    ----------------
       job queue -> |  dispatcher  |
                    |              |
                    ----------------
                          | /|\
                          |  |
                         \|/ |
                      -----------
                      |  worker |
                      |   pool  |
                      -----------

A dispatcher internally maintains a worker pool and runs a job dispatching loop assigning jobs to workers available. It then waits for all Jobs dispatched to finish and cleanup everything.

Note: a dispatcher is not meant to be reused, `Finalize()` must be called at the end to terminate its job dispatching loop. This is to avoid goroutine leaks.

## How to use

1. Download and import package.

        go get -u github.com/YSZhuoyang/go-dispatcher/dispatcher

2. Create a job dispatcher with a worker pool initialized with given size, and start listening to new jobs.

        disp, _ := dispatcher.NewDispatcher(1000)

3. Dispatch jobs (dispatch() will block until at least one worker becomes available and takes the job).

        type myJob struct {
            // ...
        }

        func (job *myJob) Do() {
            // Do something ...
        }

        disp.Dispatch(&myJob{...})

4. Wait until all jobs are done and terminate the task loop.

        disp.Finalize()
